            Happy Valentines! Aside from the fact that we aren't physically 
            together, I'm so glad we get to spend this valentines with each other. 
            Since I can't give you a letter, I decided to make you one. I mean, 
            I didn't make this from scratch and it's not much, I just got it online
            but I hope you'll like it! Dont worry, you'll receive more letters when
            you come back here again in a few months. Just wanted to give you
            something despite being 5000+ km apart from you. I love you!
            
            <p>
            love, atina
